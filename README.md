# Go Image Processing Service (GIPS)

An image processing microservice built in Go, designed to handle image uploads, perform transformations (resize, crop, format conversion), and serve optimized images for web applications.

This image processing service is intended for web developers and businesses looking to efficiently manage and deliver images on their platforms, enhancing user experience through faster load times and better image quality.

## Tech Stack
